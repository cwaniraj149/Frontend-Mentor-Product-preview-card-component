## Overview
This project is a good start to using and enhancing one's HTML and CSS skills. The overall experience of doing this project is quite good.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

Using HTML and CSS I designed this project. This project was quite simple and easy. As the actual dimensions of image and other few minor details were not provided so I assumed it by myself.  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query


### What I learned

While doing this project I used the media query property all by myself after learning it few days ago. 

Basically, through this project, I implemented media query and gain some confidence in this topic.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:flex;
  flex-direction: column; /*flex-direction is row by default.*/
   justify-content: center;  /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, space-around and space-between. */
  align-items: center; /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, stretch and baseline */
}

@media {

}

```


### Continued development

I'm still stucking in media queries so I want to continue focusing on it in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rs2ND1ryYc&t=13485s) - This helped me in learning CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - If you want to recall anything you can visit this amazing website.
