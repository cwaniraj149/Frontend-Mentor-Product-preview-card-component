## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query


### What I learned

While doing this project I used the media query property all by myself after learning it few days ago. 

Basically, through this project, I implemented media query and gain some confidence in this topic.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display:flex;
  flex-direction: column; /*flex-direction is row by default.*/
   justify-content: center;  /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, space-around and space-between. */
  align-items: center; /* Values: flex-start, flex-end, stretch and baseline */
}

@media {

}

```
```


### Continued development

I'm still stucking in media queries so I want to continue focusing on it in future projects.


### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Rs2ND1ryYc&t=13485s) - This helped me in learning CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - If you want to recall anything you can visit this amazing website.
